# Candy Crush — Microsoft Access Database Project

This project is a simple database application built using **Microsoft Access** as part of my **first semester** coursework in Informatics Engineering.

## 🍭 About the Project

The **Candy Crush** database simulates a candy store system that allows for:

- Managing customer data
- Tracking candy inventory
- Recording and reporting transactions

The project demonstrates how a relational database can be used to organize and analyze simple business operations.

## 📊 Features

- **Customers Table**: Stores customer information (name, contact, etc.)
- **Candies Table**: Lists available candy types, prices, and stock
- **Transactions Table**: Records purchases made by customers
- **Forms**: Easy-to-use interfaces for adding and editing data
- **Queries**: Used for filtering and summarizing data (e.g., top buyers, stock alerts)
- **Reports**: Printable summaries such as daily sales or inventory lists

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- Microsoft Access (.accdb)
- Relational database design
- Form and report builder
- Basic SQL for queries and relationships

## 💡 What I Learned

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in:

- Designing normalized relational databases
- Creating user-friendly forms and navigation menus
- Writing queries for data retrieval and reporting
- Understanding how databases are used in real-life applications

> Note: To explore the database, open the `.accdb` file using Microsoft Access.
