# First Semester Projects — Wizzard vs Goblins & Candy Crush Database

This repository contains the two main projects I worked on during my **first semester** as an Informatics Engineering student.

## 🕹️ Project 1: Wizzard vs Goblins (Game)

**Wizzard vs Goblins** is a simple 2D game that I developed to practice basic game logic, input handling, and interaction design. The player controls a wizard who must defeat waves of goblins using spells and movement.

This project helped me explore:
- Game logic design
- Event-driven programming
- Real-time player input and screen updates

## 🗃️ Project 2: Candy Crush (Database App)

The **Candy Crush** project is a database application I built using **Microsoft Access**. It’s designed to simulate simple database operations such as:

- Customer data management
- Candy inventory tracking
- Purchase logging and reporting

### 📊 Features:
- Tables for customers, candies, transactions
- Forms for user-friendly data entry
- Queries and reports for analysis and summaries

This project helped me learn:
- How to design relational databases
- Create user-friendly forms and interfaces
- Implement query logic and data integrity rules using Access
