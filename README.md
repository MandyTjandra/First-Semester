# 🎮 First Semester Projects – Wizzard vs Goblins

Hi! Welcome to my first semester repo.
This is my very first game project — **Wizzard vs Goblins** — built using **Construct 3**.
I followed a tutorial to get started but added a few personal touches, like a **lose screen** 🎉

## 🕹️ How to Play

* **Move** with the arrow keys
* **Left-click** to shoot fireballs
* **Don't touch the goblins** or... you lose! 😝

## 🔁 Restarting

If you lose, simply **reopen the game** to try again!
