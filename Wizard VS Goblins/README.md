# 🎮 First Semester Projects – Wizzard vs Goblins

Hi! Welcome to my first semester repo.  
This is my very first game project — **Wizzard vs Goblins** — built using **Construct 3**.  
I followed a tutorial to get started but added a few personal touches, like a **lose screen** 🎉

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. **Download** the game files.
2. Open the `x64` or `x86` folder (depending on your system).
3. Double-click the `Wizzard vs Goblins` application to start the game.
4. **Move** with the arrow keys.
5. **Aim** with your mouse cursor.
6. **Left-click** to shoot fireballs.
7. **Avoid touching the goblins** or... you lose! 😝

## 🔁 Restarting

If you lose, simply **reopen the game** to try again!
